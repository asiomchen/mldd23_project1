## 2. Problems to solve:
- Problem 1 - The structure of generated molecules must be chemically correct.
- Problem 2 - Generated molecules should be obtainable through the means of simple organic synmthesis.
- Problem 3 - Generated molecules should not contain functional groups which are known to be unstable at physiological conditions.
- Problem 4 - Generated molecules should be "drug-like" and non-toxic.
